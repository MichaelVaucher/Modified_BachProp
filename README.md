# Modified_BachProp

Here you can find the output-files of the modified BachProp algorithm. 
Have fun ! 


In the Bach folder "Bach", You can find the 32 scores generated by the algorithm, restricted to the Prelude in C major BWV 846 by Johann Sebastian Bach. Note that not all scores are of excellent quality. I suggest you to look and listen to the following files :
generated_19_concatenated.mid
generated_21_concatenated.mid
generated_28_concatenated.mid
generated_29_concatenated.mid
generated_31_concatenated.mid
