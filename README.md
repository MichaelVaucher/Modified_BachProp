# Modified_BachProp

Here you can find the output files of the modified BachProp algorithm. 
Have fun! 

All files in this git can be opened and listened to with the MuseScore program.

## Bach Folder
In the Bach folder "Bach", You can find the 32 scores generated by the algorithm, restricted to the Prelude in C major BWV 846 by Johann Sebastian Bach. Note that not all scores are of excellent quality. I suggest you to look and listen to the following files :

generated_19_concatenated.mid  
generated_21_concatenated.mid  
generated_28_concatenated.mid  
generated_29_concatenated.mid  
generated_31_concatenated.mid
